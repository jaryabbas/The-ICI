        </div>
        <h3 style="color: green; font-size: 24px;">The Five Roots of Religion</h3>
        <h4 style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>1. Oneness of God (<i>Tawhid</i>)</strong></h4>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;">Say, "He is Allah—One; Allah—the Sustainer. <br> He has never had offspring, nor was He born. <br> And there is none comparable to Him." <br> <strong>Quran, Chapter, 112</strong></p>
        <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Tawhid is the religion's central and single most important concept, upon which a Muslim's entire religious adherence rests.</p>
        <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">God, according to Islam, is a universal God, rather than a local, tribal, or parochial one, and is an absolute who integrates all affirmative values.</p>
        <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Duties which follow after believing in One God, is believing in the Oneness of Universal System that all creation of this universe is of a single creator and<br> <i>Humanity is One
    
        </i> irrespective of religion, nationality, etc. and we have to honor, care & love all creations, as they are of one own’s God.</p>
    
        <h4 style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>2. Justice of God (<i>Adal</i>)</strong></h4>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;">“Allah is always standing firm on justice.<br> There is no Allah but Him, the Mighty, the Wise.”<br> <strong>Quran, Chapter, 3:18</strong></p>
        <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Anyone who believes in Islamic monotheism must also believe in God's justice. God is just, and He never wrongs.
            Moreover, He does not have a cause for injustice toward His creatures, for an injustice is an immoral action; and
            God is incapable of evil. God is omniscient and never neglects any matter. God is self-sufficient, and He is not in
            need of the help of people. God is the possessor of everything, and His wisdom transcends the universe.</p>
        <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">The question of human's predestination or freedom of choice has preoccupied humankind throughout the ages.
            Compulsionist, holds that human beings do not have the freedom of choice. Every decision, utterance, and
            action people make has already been predestined since the time of creation.
            But the Free Will, declares that human beings are masters of their own acts. This notion is in concordance with
            the Quran which states,</p>
            <p><i>“None will be wronged in anything, nor will you be requited anything except that
            which you used to do” (36:54).
           <br> “Whatever good reaches you is from Allah, but whatever evil befalls you is from yourself” (4:79).</i></p>
        <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">The action-reaction law is applicable but the end result is on God, if He will, He can change the result.
            Thus, we are in middle of Compulsion (fate) and Free Will in this world.
            <br>And Justice will be served on the Day of Judgement if anyone has suffered in this world by the unjust person.</p>
    
            <h4 style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>3. Prophethood (<i>Nabuat</i>)</strong></h4>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;">And We did not send any messenger except [speaking] in the language of
            <br>his people to state clearly our message to them. God guides or
            <br>causes to go astray whomever He wants. God is Majestic and All-wise.<br><strong>Quran, Chapter, 14:4</strong></p>
        <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Since, the advent of humanity, God provided all the necessities for humans even before their creation.
            <br>And guidance was also the essential part to be on the God’s path which is embedded in the human’s
            nature. <br>Thus, God send its infallible representative as teacher & masters in form of Prophets.</p>
        <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">In total, God send down 1,24,000 Prophets (or Messengers) in this world for our guidance starting from
            first human, Prophet Adam and the last, Prophet Muhammad [s].
            </p><p><i>"Then We sent our messengers one after another."
            (Quran 23:44)</i></p>
        <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">In between some of great Prophets came like Abraham, Noah, Solomon, Moses, Jesus etc.<br> and all
            Prophets revive the previous Prophet laws and have scrolls or books from God’s revelation.</p>
            <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Muslims hold the Quran, as it was revealed to Muhammad[s], to be God's final revelation to humankind,
                <br>and therefore a completion and confirmation of previous scriptures, such as the Bible (Injeel),
                <br>Torah (or Tawrat) , Psalms (or Zabur).</p>
    
                <h4 style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>4. Guardianship (<i>Imamate</i>)</strong></h4>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;">“Verily I make thee Imam for humankind; ‘(Abraham) said “And of my offspring”? He said: “My covenant reach
                    not the unjust”. <br> <strong>Quran, Chapter, 2:124</strong></p>
                <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Imams are the spiritual and political successors to the Holy Prophet Muhammad[s] and are exemplary
                    human individuals who not only rule over the Muslim community with justice, but are also able to preserve and
                    interpret the Islamic law ( or shariat) and the esoteric meaning of the Qur'an.</p>
                    <p><i>“On the judgement day when We will call every nation with their Imams.” -Quran, 17:71</i></p>
                    <p><i>"Whoever dies without knowing the Imam of his time dies the death of ignorance (Jāhiliyyah)."<br>-Holy Prophet Mohammad[s] (Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1851)</i></p>
                    
                    <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Imams are from Allah, through Prophet Muhammad[s]. <br>Imamate is a divinely-appointed status; it is beyond the
                    jurisdiction of the community.</p>
                    <p><i>"O you who have believed, obey Allāh and obey the Messenger and
                        those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything,
                        refer it to Allāh and the Messenger...” (Quran 4:59)</i></p>
                        
                        <p>The Holy Prophet Mohammad[s] said,<br><i>"O people, I am only a human being and I am about to respond to the messenger of my Lord [i.e. the call of death]. I am leaving behind two precious things among you.
                            <br>The first of the two is the Book of Allah, in it is guidance and light. So get hold of the Quran and adhere to it.<br>                   
                                 And my Ahlul Bayt (Household). I urge you to remember God regarding my Ahlul Bayt..."
                            <br>(Sahih Muslim, part 7, Kitab fada'il al-­Sahabah [Maktabat wa Matba’at Muhammad ‘Ali Subayh wa Awladuhu: Cairo] pp. 122-123.)</i></p>
                            
                <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Hence, the words and deeds (or sunnah) of Prophet Muhammad[s] and the 12 Imams are a guide
                    and model for the Muslim community to follow;</p>
                    <p><i>"Islam will not end until there have been Twelve Caliphs.”<br>- Holy Prophet Muhammad[s] (Sahih Bukhaari (no. 7222); Sahih Muslim (no. 1821))</i></p> 
                <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;"><br>Just as every Prophet is infallible, so too are Lady Fatima Zahra[s] and the Twelve Imams are free from error and sin from God’s protection, a doctrine known as Ismah (or infallibility).<br> Ismah is essential to uphold the authenticity of divine law and ensure the guide's absolute credibility.
                </p><p><i>Indeed Allah desires to repel all impurity from you, O People of the Mohammad's Household, and purify you with a thorough purification. (Quran 33:33)</i></p>
                <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Imam Ali, is the 1st Imam appointed by Allah in Ghadeer 632 CE, through Prophet Muhammad[s]</p>
                 <p>
                   <i>"O Messenger, convey what has been sent down to you from your Lord. If you do not, then you have not delivered His message.
                        And Allah will protect you from the people. Indeed, Allah does not guide the disbelieving people." (Quran 5:67)</i>
                 </p>
                 <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Then the Holy Prophet Mohammad[s] gathered the companions and, holding Ali's hand, declared:</p>  
                 <p><i>"Do I not have more right over the believers than they have over themselves?"</i><br>
                    <br>Companions replied:<i>"Yes, O Messenger of Allah."</i>
                    <br><p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Then he said:</p>"Whomever I am his master (Mawla), Ali is his master (Mawla). O Allah, befriend those who befriend him, and be hostile to those who are hostile to him."</b>
                    <br>(Sunan al-Tirmidhi (3713, 3714); Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal (Hadith 21578, 21579, 21580, etc.))</p> 
                    <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Then God said:</p><i> "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved<br> Islam as your religion." (Quran 5:3)</i></p>
                    <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Muhammad Mahdi, is the 12th and current Imam.<br><br> He is in occultation ( or ghayba) by
                        Allah’s will and will reappear at the End of Times to rid the world of evil and injustice.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>5. Day ofJudgement and Resurrection (<i>Qayamat</i>)</strong></h4>
            <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;">"Verily We shall give life to the dead, and We record all that they send before and that they leave behind, and
                We have taken account of all things in a clear Book [of evidence]." <br>(Quran, 36:12)<br>
                <br>And to every soul will be paid in full of its deeds, and He knows best all that they do. <br>(Quran, 39:70)<br> </p>
            <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">The day of resurrection will be the time when all of humankind will be brought back to their original physical form. 
                <br>Every human being, from the past to the present, will be resurrected and examined by their deeds.<br> This day is called the “Day of Judgment.”
                <br>Human being does not end at death, but, in fact, continues afterward towards a new life.<br> The Quran calls this life
                the “true life.”
                <br><br>Many people wonder if eventually humankind is going to die out, why then were people created in the first
                place?<br>
                Humankind was created to be the caretaker of the earth; thus, life on earth becomes a test, to maintain and
                preserve nature. More importantly, to maintain and preserve our moral natures.
                <br><br>According to Islam, a person will be judged according to his or her life's actions.<br> People whose deeds and
                actions in life are mainly good will enter Heaven (or Paradise).<br> However, if one's deeds or actions are mainly evil,
                he or she will enter Hell.<br> On the Day of Judgment, everyone will know the fate of everyone else.
